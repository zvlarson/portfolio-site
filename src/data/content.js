    title: 'About Me',
    bio: `I'm a results-driven leader who partners with executive stakeholders to define organizational goals, conduct comprehensive operational assessments, and develop targeted solutions. I evaluate processes to locate waste, bottlenecks, and gaps—then translate observations into actionable improvements aligned with strategic objectives.

My career spans leadership roles at Fortune 500 companies and high-growth startups—where I've served as an executive partner to C-suite leaders on special projects ranging from enterprise-wide organizational effectiveness analyses to large-scale candidate experience transformations.

I hold an MBA in Supply Chain Management & Marketing from Florida State University, along with SHRM-SCP certification and credentials in Software Engineering (Boca Code) and Product Management (The Product School). I guide transformation initiatives from concept through implementation to sustainable adoption.`,
